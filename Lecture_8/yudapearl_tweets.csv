If order for ""relative efficacy"" to be a PURPOSE of an estimation exercise, it must be defined somewhere (external to RCT). Otherwise it sounds like: ""Purpose of RCT: estimate whatever it estimates""."

It saves some people and kills others, the former and the latter are each 10% of the population and, obviously, non-intersecting.  Do we really need to say it at such length? Let's get to the meet of things and ask: Can we devise a test for the two models?"

Devise a test to determine which model is behind our data.

Model-2 – The drug saves 10% of the population and kills another 10%."
